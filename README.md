# 🛰️ Satellite Image Analysis Platform (AI-Assisted Development)

## 📋 Project Overview

This project showcases my approach to developing a complex satellite image analysis application using AI-assisted techniques. Starting with just basic drawings and fundamental concepts, I leveraged AI tools to rapidly develop a functional prototype that would typically require extensive expertise in geospatial analysis and computer vision.
